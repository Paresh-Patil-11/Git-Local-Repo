# Understanding Git and GitHub

Git is a distributed version control system that enables developers to track changes in their codebase, collaborate with others, and manage project versions efficiently. GitHub is a cloud-based platform built around Git that allows developers to host their repositories, collaborate with teams, and contribute to open-source projects.

## Key Concepts

- **Repository (Repo):** A directory or storage space where your project files and their version histories are stored. Repositories can be local (on your machine) or remote (on platforms like GitHub).
  
- **Commit:** A snapshot of your project at a given time. Each commit has a unique ID and can include a message describing the changes made.

- **Branch:** A parallel version of the main project. Branches allow you to work on features or fixes independently of the main codebase (usually called `main` or `master`).

- **Merge:** Combining the changes from one branch into another. Typically, this involves merging a feature branch back into the main branch.

- **Pull Request (PR):** A GitHub feature that allows developers to request the merging of changes from one branch into another. PRs facilitate code review and discussion before merging.
